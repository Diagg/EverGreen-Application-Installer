Sounds to good to be true ? ..Sure but it is !!

Greenstaller doesn't needs tho create package because it downloads latest version of application binary directly from their author site using Evergreen and NeverGreen.

Greenstaller doesn't either needs to create package to customize installation. the logic and science you historically embedded in your package is now publically stored on Github

If you have internet and admin rights on your endpoints you already have the requiered infrastructure in place !

If your endpoints are managed by an MDM, Greenstaller will ease your application managment even further! No need to embed application sources in your MDM app. everything you need is embedded in a single command line.
No need to update your MDM application each time an update is published. Greenstaller allow 'set it & forget it' app managment.
